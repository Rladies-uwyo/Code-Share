# Code-Share

This is a github repository for RLadies members to share any code/files that may be useful for the group. Please keep everything organized by adding your files as part of a directory/folder that fits the category of your codes/files.

Add files using the "add files/upload files" button. Make sure you are adding them to correct folder/directory. If there is no proper folder/directory that exists for your upload, then upload your files within those named folders (i.e., make the folders in your computer files first and then drag the entire folder into the upload page on github).

To download directories/folders use this website: https://download-directory.github.io/
