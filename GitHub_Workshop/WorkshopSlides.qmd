### How do I use version control?

- git adds a ".git" folder to a **repository** and records your commits/adds there

* git does not track changes automatically. You need to make commits using the **command line** or a **git client**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You can use git to track changes on your local files without ever connecting to a git service like GitHub! (although most people don't do this...)

![](presentationImgs/github-mark.png){width="100"} git becomes even more useful when you connect your "local" git repositories (on your computer) to a "remote" (online) service such as GitHub




------------------------------------------------------------------------

### When would you use version control?

-   to keep track of changes that *you* make in your files
    -   you have a record of when and why you made changes to a file
    -   you can revert to a previous version of a file quite easily! (and if you have informative commit messages, it's easy to find the version you need!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   why would a person want to use version control?
    -   keep track of changes for yourself, esp. across multiple computers
    -   keep track of and share changes on collaborative projects
-   version control is typically used for code (*not* data), but can also be used for writing, presentations, etc.
