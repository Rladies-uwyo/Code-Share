## **What** is an R package?

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em; color: red;"}
> "Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data."\

::: 

## R packages are...

::: incremental
-   #### Portable 
    * Everything in an R package directory (functions, documentation, data, etc.) is "built" into a "tarball" (packageName.tar.gz) that can easily be downloaded, installed into your local R package library, and loaded into R
-   #### Open source
    * If you install a package, you can see all the function code

:::

## **Why** would I want to make an R package?

::: incremental
- Share R functions with others (for a general audience!)
  * via the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork [(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html){target="_blank"}, [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software){target="_blank"}, even GitHub
- Share R functions with others (in your lab, company, etc.)
  * via GitHub or other file sharing tool
- Store functions for yourself!
